# TV-Halftime-Shows-and-the-Big-Game
Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. 
In this notebook, I focussed on finding out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, I got answers to questions like:

What are the most extreme game outcomes?
How does the game affect television viewership?
How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

The dataset I have used was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. 
It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
